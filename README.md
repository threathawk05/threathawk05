## 💼 Projects

Here are some of the projects I’m working on:

### 🔐 [Secure File Storage System](https://github.com/threathawk05/Secure-File-Storage-System)
- The Secure File Storage System is a Python-based encryption tool with a user-friendly PyQt5 GUI. It allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt files using strong cryptographic algorithms.


### 🖥️ [Windows Keylogger](https://github.com/threathawk05/PRODIGY_CS_04)
- This is a simple **keylogger** application built in Python. It records keystrokes and stores them in a log file. The log file contains timestamps and the keys pressed.

### 🔑 [Password Generator](https://github.com/threathawk05/VAULT_TEC_SECURITY)
- A Python tool that generates secure and customizable passwords using four different algorithms.

### 🛡️ [Password Strength Checker](https://github.com/threathawk05/PRODIGY_CS_03)
- A tool that checks the strength of your password, and gives you feedback.

### 🔐 [Image Encryption Tool](https://github.com/threathawk05/PRODIGY_CS_02)
- An image encryption and decryption tool.

### 💻 [Caesar Cipher Program](https://github.com/threathawk05/PRODIGY_CS_01)
- A text encryption and decryption tool.

### 💻 [Railway Reservation Project](https://github.com/threathawk05/Railway-Reservation-Project)  
- A Java-based application for seamless train ticket booking, cancellation, and PNR status tracking. Built with Java (Swing), MySQL, and JDBC, it ensures secure user authentication, admin control, and real-time availability checks.
## 📚 Learning & Growth

- Currently diving deeper into SOC (Security Operations Center) operations and digital forensics.
- Exploring more Python programming for cybersecurity and automation.
